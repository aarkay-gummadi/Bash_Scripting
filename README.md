Bash Scripting
--------------

* Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks and processes in Linux. Letâ€™s dive into the details:

### What is a Bash Shell?
* The Linux command line is provided by a program called the shell.
* The default shell for many Linux distributions is the GNU Bourne-Again Shell (bash).
* When you launch the shell, it displays a prompt (usually $ for regular users and # for the superuser).
* Bash simplifies operations that are hard to accomplish efficiently with a graphical user interface (GUI).


### What is a Bash Script?
* A bash script is a series of commands written in a file.
* These commands are read and executed by the bash program line by line.
* For example, you can navigate to a specific path, create a folder, and spawn a process using the command line.
* By saving these commands in a bash script, you can run the same sequence of steps any number of times.


### How Do You Identify a Bash Script?
* Bash scripts typically have a file extension of `.sh`.
* They start with a shebang (the first line of the script), which specifies the bash shell path.
* The shebang tells the shell to execute the script via bash.


### Why Use Bash Scripting?
* Automation: Bash scripts allow you to automate repetitive tasks.
* Customization: You can customize behavior, set environment variables, and execute specific actions.
* CLI Power: Most servers lack a GUI, so learning to use the command line interface (CLI) is essential.
